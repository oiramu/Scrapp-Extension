# Scrapp-Extension
A chrome extension that get's record of any data in a dom page

## How does it work
It reads the page's DOM and get's any data (and even encrypted) that you wan't to record, you can set it to work with any id key of any page as you wan't to scrap on, just be smart and do not use it for bad propurces

## Use
Do anything you wan't the example works over the outlook mail view and get's record of the stuff i putted in...for educationar propurces

## Is it collaborative?
Yes! just expand it wherever you wan't it to, feel free to do it if you credit my first iteration of the code
